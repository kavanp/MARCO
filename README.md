# MARCO Dataset  

Classification of crystallization outcomes using deep convolutional neural networks.
The Machine Recognition of Crystallization Outcomes (MARCO) initiative has assembled roughly half a million annotated  images of macromolecular crystallization experiments from various sources and setups. The datasets contains images belonging to either of 4 classes i.e., Clear, Precipitate, Crystals or Other.

## Classes
0 - Clear<br>
1 - Crystals <br> 
2 - Other <br>
3 - Precipitate <br>
